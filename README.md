## Passkey Authenticator AAGUIDs

This is a community-driven list of known passkey provider AAGUIDs to assist with naming passkeys in end user passkey management interaces (e.g. account settings). It is not intended to be used for any other purpose.

This does not replace [FIDO's Metadata Service (MDS)](https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/), which should continue to be used for all authoritative security details about FIDO authenticators. Some AAGUIDs in this list may not appear in FIDO MDS.
